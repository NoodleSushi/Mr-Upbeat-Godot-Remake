# Developer Notes
- This one of my earliest introductions to developing rhythm games, which led me to develop [Slimy Justice](https://github.com/NoodleSushi/Slimy-Justice).
- Innacurate timings were inevitable due to the limitations of Godot at that time, as the `get_time_since_last_mix()` method from the Audio Server was unavailable.

# Project Setup
Install the latest [Godot Engine 3.0.x](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.0.6-stable/) release

# Credits
- Audio assets, art assets, and the game are based on the minigame "Mr Upbeat" from "Rhythm Heaven Fever," published by Nintendo.
